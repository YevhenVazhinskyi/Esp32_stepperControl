## 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL PROJECT RULE 🚨🚨🚨
## NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER
## NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER
## NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER
## CHANGE GPIO PIN MAPPING IN THIS PROJECT!!!
## 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

**GPIO pins are FINAL and defined in: `components/common/include/common_types.h`**
