|Communication Patterns|
note right : Inter-Task Communication:\n• Motor commands via FreeRTOS queues\n• BLE events via callbacks\n• Direct GATT to stepper motor API calls\n• Error signaling via status flags

|Timing Constraints|
note left : Real-Time Requirements:\n• Motor steps: 1-1000ms configurable\n• BLE responses: <30ms\n• Fault detection: <100ms\n• Queue processing: 10ms timeout\n• Status updates: 100ms intervals

note right : Data Flow Directions:\n• BLE Client Commands → GATT Server (Characteristic writes)\n• GATT Server → Stepper Motor API (Direct function calls)\n• Stepper Motor API → Motor Queue (Command messages)\n• Motor Task → Hardware (GPIO pin control)\n• Hardware → Motor Task (Fault pin reading)\n• Motor Task → BLE Notifications (Position updates)\n• System Monitor → All Components (Status queries)\n• Error Handlers → All Components (Recovery actions)

|Concurrent Execution|
partition "Parallel Activities" {
    :Main monitoring task (100ms cycle);
    :Motor control task (10ms queue timeout);
    :BLE host task (event-driven);
    :System status logging (10s cycle);
    :Fault detection (continuous);
    :LED indicators (real-time);
}

|System States Integration|
switch (Current system state?)
case (SYSTEM_INIT)
    :Execute initialization flow;
case (SYSTEM_READY)
    :Full operational mode;
    :Enable monitoring activities;
    :Handle commands;
case (SYSTEM_TESTING)
    :Test suite execution;
case (SYSTEM_ERROR)
    :Error recovery activities;
endswitch

:System operational and responsive;

note right : System Design Principles:\n• Modular component architecture\n• Thread-safe inter-task communication\n• Graceful error handling and recovery\n• Real-time responsiveness\n• Hardware abstraction\n• Comprehensive testing and validation
